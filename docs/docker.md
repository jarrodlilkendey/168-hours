## Docker

-   In production, this application will run in a Docker container on a virtual machine

### Why Use Docker

-   I want to get experience using NextJS within a Docker container rather than running it serverless
-   I want to understand the performance implications of running NextJS in a Docker container
-   I want to reduce reliance on Vercel from their hosting services
-   I want to minimise costs running multiple applications that get low traffic on a VPS within Docker

### Docker Implementation

-   I can't figure out how to load the env variables (related thread - https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-compose-env-file-behavior-is-confusing/113526/6)
-   https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/set-environment-variables/
